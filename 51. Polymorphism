/* POLYMORPHISM

References are polymorphic. 
A variable of type x can refer to an object that subclasses x. */ 

// Example: 

public static void Display (Asset asset) 
{
	System.Console.WriteLine (asset.Name);
}



// This method can display both a Stock and a House, since they are both Assets: 


Stock msft = new Stock ... ;
House mansion = new House ... ;

Display (msft);
Display (mansion); 


/* Polymorphism works on the basis that subclasses (Stock and House) have all the
features of their base class (Asset). It does not work in reverse. */
