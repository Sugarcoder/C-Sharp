/* 'THIS' REFERENCE

'This' reference = refers to the instance itself. 

'This' reference is valid only within non-static members of a class or struct.  */


// Example 
// (The Marry method uses 'this' to set the partner's mate field):


public class Panda
{
	public Panda Mate;
	
	public void Marry (Panda partner)
	{
		Mate = partner;
		partner.Mate = this;
	}
}



// 'This' reference also disambiguates a local variable or parameter from a field.

// Example: 


public class Test
{
	string name;
	public test (string name) 
	{
		this.name = name;
	}
}
