// 'Class' is the most common kind of reference type.


class YourClassName
{
}


/* A more complex 'class' has:

- Preceding the 'class' keyword: Attributes and class modifiers
  	Non-nested modifiers are public, internal, abstract, sealed, static, unsafe and partial.
  
- Followering YourClassName: Generic type parameters, a base class, and interfaces

- Within the braces: Class members 
	(methods, properties, indexes, events, fields, constructors, 
	 overloaded operators, nested types, and a finalizer).
