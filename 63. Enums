/* Enum = A special value type that lets you specify 
a group of named numeric constants. */


// Example: 

public enum BorderSide 
{
	Left, Right, Top, Bottom
}


// This is how you use it:

BorderSide topSide = BorderSide.Top;
bool isTop = (topSide == BorderSide.Top);    // True




/* Each enum has an underlying integral value. This is by default: 

- Underlying values are type 'int'.

- The constants 0, 1, 2...are automatically assigned in the declaration order of the enum members. */





// You can convert an enum instance to and from its underlying integral value with a explicit cast:

int i = (int) BorderSide.Left;
BorderSide side = (BorderSide) i;
bool leftOrRight = (int) side <= 2;



// You can explicitly cast one enum type to another:

public enum HorizonAlignment
{
	Left = BorderSide.Left,
	Right = BorderSide.Right, 
	Center
}
