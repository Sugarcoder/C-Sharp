/* Switch statements let you branch program execution based on a 
selection of possible values that a variable may have. 

Switch statements may result in cleaner codes than multiple 'if' statements. */


// Example:

static void ShowCard(int cardNumber)
{
	switch (cardNumber)
	{
		case 13: 
			Console.WriteLine ("King");
		case 12: 
			Console.WriteLine ("Queen");
		case 11: 
			Console.WriteLine ("Jack");
		case -1:                          // Joke is case -1
			goto case 12;                 // In this game, Joke counts as queen
		default:                          // Executes for any other cardNumber
			Console.WriteLine (cardNumber);
			break;
	}
}



/* At the end of each 'case' clause, you must state where execution is to go next,
with some kind of jump statement. 

- break (jumps to the end of the switch statement)

- goto case x (jumps to another case clause)

- goto default (jumps to the default clause)

- Any other jump statement (ex. return, throw, continue, goto ______)  */




/* When more than one value should execute the same code,
you can list the common cases sequentially:  */

switch (cardNumber)
{
	case 13: 
	case 12: 
	case 11: 
		Console.WriteLine ("Face card");
	default:
		Console.WriteLine ("Plain card");
		break;
}
