/* VARIABLE DECLARATION

A declaration satement declares a new variable. */

// Example: 

string someWord = "rosebud";
int someNumber = 10;
bool rich = true, famous = false;


// You can have multiple variables in a comma-separated list.



/* CONSTANT DECLARATION 

A Constant declaration is similar to a variable declaration, 
except it can't be changed once declared. */

// Example:

const double c = 2.99789;
c += 10;                     // Compile-time Error



/* LOCAL VARIABLES

The scope of a local variable (or local constant) extends throughout the current block.

You cannot declare another local variable with the same name in the current block (or in any nested blocks). */

// Example: 

static void Main()
{
	int x;
	{
		int y;
		int x;   // Error - x is already defined
	}
	
	{
		int y;    // OK - y is not in scope
	}
	
	Console.Write (y);   // Error - y is out of scope
}
