/* ABSTRACT CLASSES

A class declared as abstract can never be instantiated. 
Only its concrete subclasses can be instantiated. 

Abstract classes are able to define abstract members. */



/* 

ABSTRACT MEMBERS 

Abstract members are like virtual members, 
except they don't provide a default implementation. 

That implementation must be provided by the subclass, 
unless the subclass is declared as 'abstract' as well. */

// Example: 

public abstract class Asset
{
	// Note the empty implementation
	public abstract decimal NetValue 
	{
		get;
	}
}


public class Stock : Asset
{
	public long SharesOwned;
	public decimal CurrentPrice;
	
	// Override like a virtual method.
	public override decimal NetValue
	{
		get
		{	
			return CurrentPrice * SharesOwned;
		}
	}
}
