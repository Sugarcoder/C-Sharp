// CASTING & REFERENCE CONVERSIONS PT. 2


/* The 'as' Operator 

The 'as' operator performs a downcast that eveluates to 'null', if the downcast fails. */

// Example: 

Asset a = new Asset();
Stock s = a as Stock;     // s is null, no exception thrown


// This is to test whether the result is null or not: 

if (s != null) Console.WriteLine (s.SharesOwned);




/* The 'is' Operator

The 'is' operator tests whether a reference conversion 
would succeed or not (whether an object derives from a specified class).  */

// Example: 

if (a is Stock)
	Console.WriteLine (((Stock)a).SharesOwned);


/* The 'is' operator does not consider custom or numeric conversions, 
but it does consider unboxing conversions. */
