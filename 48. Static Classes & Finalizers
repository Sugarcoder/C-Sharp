/* STATIC CLASSES 

A class can be marked "static", indiecating that it must be composed
solely of static members and cannot be subclassed.

Examples: System.Console & System.Math are static classes.



FINALIZERS 

Finalizers are class-only methods that execute before the garbage collector reclaims the memory for an unreferenced object.  */

// Example:

class Class1
{
	~Class1()
	{
		...
	}
}


/* Finalizers allow this modifier: 

- Unmanaged code modifier: unsafe  */
