/* The 'base' keyword is similar to the 'this' keyword. 

It is used for: 

- Accessing an overriden function member from the subclass

- Calling a base-class constructor  */


// Example: 

public class House : Asset 
{
	...
	public override decimal Liability
	{
		get
		{
			return base.Liability + Mortgage;
		}
	}
}
